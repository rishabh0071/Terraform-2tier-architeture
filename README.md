# Terraform-2tier-architeture

ğŸ“‹ Our Plan: Deploying a Two-Tier Application Architecture in AWS Using Terraform as Infrastructure as Code

ğŸ“‹ Why Terraform? - While it is possible to manually create each component of our infrastructure using the AWS console, we have chosen to leverage Terraform as our Infrastructure as Code tool. With Terraform, we can write code that automates the deployment of the entire infrastructure with just a few clicks, streamlining the process significantly.

We will deploy the following components:

ğŸ›  Custom VPC
ğŸ›  Configuration of 2 public subnets
ğŸ›  Configuration of 2 private subnets
ğŸ›  Provisioning of Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
ğŸ›  Association of public route table
ğŸ›  Association of private route table
ğŸ›  Launching 2 EC2 instances with bootstrapped Apache in public subnets
ğŸ›  Launching 1 RDS MySQL micro instance in a private subnet
ğŸ›  Setting up security groups for the web tier and database tier
ğŸ›  Configuration of Load Balancer with LB Target and Listener
